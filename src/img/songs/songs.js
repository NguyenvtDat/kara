    I told you that I never would
    I told you I'd change
    Even when I knew I never could
    I know that I can't
    Find nobody else as good as you
    I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
    I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
    I realize the time that I wasted here
    I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
    Oh, I'll be *** up if you can't be right here
    Oh, ooh-woah
    Oh, ooh-woah
    Oh, ooh-woah
    Oh, I'll be *** up if you can't be right here

    I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
    When I'm away from you, I miss your touch
    You're the reason I believe in love
    It's been difficult for me to trust
    And I'm afraid that I'ma *** it up
    Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
    Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed
    And you know that I know
    That I can't live without you
    So, baby, stay
    Oh, ooh-woah
    Oh, ooh-woah
    Oh, ooh-woah
    I'll be *** up if you can't be right here
    I do the same thing

    Wrinkled silk on my sheets

    We'll be friends forever

  Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
  She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday
  Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
  If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same

  Not a footprint to be seen
  A kingdom of isolation
  And it looks like I'm the queen
  The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
  Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
  Don't let them in, don't let them see
  Be the good girl you always have to be
  Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
  Well, now they know
  Let it go, let it go
  Can't hold it back anymore
  Let it go, let it go
  Turn away and slam the door
  I don't care what they're going to say
  Let the storm rage on
  The cold never bothered me anyway
  Let it go, let it go
  Can't hold it back anymore
  Let it go, let it go
  Turn away and slam the door
  Let it go (go, go, go go, go go, go go, go, go, go go)
  Let it go
  Let it go
  Let it go
  It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
  And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
  It's time to see what I can do
  To test the limits and break through
  No right, no wrong, no rules for me
  I'm free
  Let it go, let it go
  I am one with the wind and sky
  Let it go, let it go
  You'll never see me cry
  Here I stand and here I stay
  Let the storm rage on
  My power flurries through the air into the ground
  My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
  And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
  I'm never going back, the past is in the past
  Let it go
  The cold never bothered me anyway
  Let it go, let it go
  And I'll rise like the break of dawn
  Let it go, let it go
  That perfect girl is gone
  Here I stand in the light of day
  Let the storm rage on`,

  Today I don't feel like doing anything
  I just wanna lay in my bed
  Don't feel like picking up my phone
  So leave a message at the tone
  'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
  Nothing at all
  Ooh hoo ooh hoo
  Hoo ooh ooh
  Nothing at all
  Ooh hoo ooh hoo
  Hoo ooh ooh
  Tomorrow I'll wake up do some p90x
  Meet a really nice girl have some really nice sex
  And she's gonna scream out this is great
  I might mess around and get my college degree
  I bet my old man will be so proud of me
  But sorry pops you'll just have to wait
  Oh
  Yes I said it
  I said it
  I said it 'cause I can
  Today I don't feel like doing anything
  I just wanna lay in my bed
  Don't feel like picking up my phone
  So leave a message at the tone
  'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
  No I ain't gonna comb my hair
  'Cause I ain't goin' anywhere
  No no no no no no no no no oh
  I'll just strut in my birthday suit
  And let everything hang loose
  Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
  Oh, today I don't feel like doing anything
  I just wanna lay in my bed
  Don't feel like picking up my phone
  So leave a message at the tone
  'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
  Nothing at all
  Ooh hoo ooh hoo
  Hoo ooh ooh
  Nothing at all
  Ooh hoo ooh hoo
  Hoo ooh ooh
  Nothing at all`,
